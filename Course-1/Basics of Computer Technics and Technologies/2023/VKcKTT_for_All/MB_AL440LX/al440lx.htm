<p><br>

<font size=+1>I bought my Intel AL440LX motherboard soon after it was
first released. Like most people, I've had to deal with some of its quirks,
and more annoyingly, the lack of support by Intel. If you've visited Intel's
newsgroup, I'm sure you've found out that some of the tech support people
would make great politicians, because they never really answer your question.</font>
<p><font size=+1>I've created installation guides for Windows 95, 98, and 2000 as well as BIOS archives and other useful information and resources. If
you'd like to see something else on this site, let me know. Additionally,
Intel's news server can be found at forums.intel.com, and support for the
AL440LX can be found in the intel.motherboards.pentium_ii newsgroup. You
may also want to check <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google Groups</a> to
search the newsgroup archives.</font>

<p><font size=+1>I don't work for Intel nor do I represent them in any
way, other than that I use their products. I've been building custom computers
for several years. The piece of paper on the wall says I'm a Systems Engineer, I
work on computers full time, but I'm actually an aviator by trade.
But, if you're having problems getting your AL440LX to work right, feel

I'll see what I can do to help.</font>
